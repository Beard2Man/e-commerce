# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run server`

Launches APIs stored in files, needed for proper operation of the application.
This API was written and implemented by me. 
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


                                             ### DESCRIPTION ###

                                             
E-commerce - this is my first standalone application. I tried to introduce solutions that I am able to implement myself. 
Of course, there are solutions here that were taken from other projects or websites, they are not copied they were an inspiration and teaching aid.
I learned the principle of operation of a particular solution, which gave me the opportunity to later implement and adapt to my needs.
I plan to add a few more solutions to the whole application, including a forum and the ability to register and also log in.
At the moment I'm creating them as separate projects, which in time will also be part of the "e-commerce".
